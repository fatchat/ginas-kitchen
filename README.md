Gina's Kitchen
==============

My sister has a catering business, and her website is really bad. As a birthday present I offered to create a "modern" site for her.

This is being done using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). It is going to progress slowly, since she lives in a different city and we're both busy.
